# YTDownloader

This is a fork of a YouTube downloader that was pretty simple.

This version adds:
* Ability to choose the stream
* A detailed progress meter
* A progress meter and a Gauge in the main window

This screenshot shows using it normally

This screenshot shows the detailed progress meter.

This detailed meter can be added to your code by inserting a single line of code.  PySimpleGUI has a call named "one_line_progress_meter" that when added to your loop will display a small window with download stastics.
